Installing Librepilot under Gentoo Linux
========================================

Introduction
------------
The codebase for LibrePilot compiles under linux, windows and
iOS. There are a number of libraries and tools which install to enable
the compilation environment to be consistent for the different
developers working on different platforms. The ebuilds created for
Gentoo installation use the system installed libraries, and do not
install the packages, except for the arm compiler. Getting a
system wide arm compiler working was considered to be more difficult
than just downloading the arm package and installing it in the build
environment. The implication of this decision is that the arm compiler
will download and install every time you install LibrePilot.

The installation has been checked on one system. It is possible a
dependency has been missed from the ebuild - if you find any issues
with building or running, please let me know.

Preparation for Installation
----------------------------
You need to install and set up layman
(https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman), then add the librepilot overlay:

> layman -a librepilot

You can now proceed with installing the latest stable release or the
"next" development branch.

Installation
------------

If you have previously installed LibrePilot by running "make install"
as root, you will need to run "make uninstall" first to remove all the
files which have been installed. Check everything has been removed by
removing the following directories
   /usr/local/share/librepilot-gcs
   /usr/local/lib64/librepilot-gcs

Also confirm that /usr/local/lib is a symbolic pointer to
/usr/local/lib64. This changed recently with the baselayout update to
2.4.1-r2, and in fact if you have librepilot installed when making
this update it will fail. If you have issues with baselayout updates,
unmerge librepilot while updating baselayout.

You can choose to install the latest release, or the next branch from
the git repository. Instructions for both follow.

Installing the latest Release
-----------------------------
Now you can install Librepilot:

> emerge -av librepilot

I have marked the ebuilds as unstable ("~"), as they haven't been extensively
tested on different computers. Therefore, you will be presented with
the option to add some changes to use flags:

-------------8<---------------
    The following keyword changes are necessary to proceed:
     (see "package.accept_keywords" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
    # required by librepilot (argument)
    =app-misc/librepilot-16.09 ~amd64

    Would you like to add these changes to your config files? [Yes/No]
-------------8<---------------

Accept the changes, then run dispatch-conf to incorporate them, before
running the emerge command again.

The package should now proceed to build and install.

Installing the latest development branch
----------------------------------------

For the latest "next" branch from the repository, you need to install
using the following command:

> emerge -av =app-misc/librepilot-9999

Again, you will be offered some changes to the use flags:

-------------8<---------------
    The following keyword changes are necessary to proceed:
     (see "package.accept_keywords" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
    # required by =app-misc/librepilot-9999 (argument)
    =app-misc/librepilot-9999 **

    NOTE: The --autounmask-keep-masks option will prevent emerge
          from creating package.unmask or ** keyword changes.
-----------8<------------------

Depending on your settings, you may have to add the changes manually
to your configuration files.

Then run the emerge command again, and it should install.


Running GCS
-----------
Part of the build process includes adding an environment variable for
the google maps version. If you run the librepilot-gcs before logging
out and back in, you will have issues with the maps in the flight
tab. Alternatively, run the following command from a user shell:

> . /etc/profile


Problems?
---------
Please contact paulj@librepilot.org, and I will try my best to sort
you out!
