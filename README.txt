About the LibrePilot Project
----------------------------

Open - Collaborative - Free 

The LibrePilot open source project was founded in July 2015. It focuses on 
research and development of software and hardware to be used in a variety of 
applications including vehicle control and stabilization, unmanned autonomous
vehicles and robotics. One of the projectâ€™s primary goals is to provide an open
and collaborative environment making it the ideal home for development of 
innovative ideas.

LibrePilot welcomes and encourages exchange and collaboration with other 
projects, like adding support for existing hardware or software in 
collaboration under the spirit of open source.
 
LibrePilot finds its roots in the OpenPilot project and the founding members
are all long-standing contributors in that project.

The LibrePilot project will be governed by a board of members using consensual
methods to make important decisions and to set the overall direction of the
project.
