        <!-- The following comments come from / are extrapolated from various TauLabs / dRonin sources. -->
        <!-- TL / dRonin requires you to adjust two sliders, one called RateDamp and the other called RateNoise. -->
        <!-- They have documented that certain pairings of damp and noise go together well. -->
        <!-- The LP code uses these "known good pairs" to weld the damp and noise scales together into the SmoothQuick slider. -->
        <!-- When using the SmoothQuick slider you automatically get an interpolated matching pair of damp and noise. -->
        <!-- So be aware that these comments refer to the TL/dRronin slider names. -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- Decrease damping to make your aircraft response more rapidly. Increase it for more stability. -->
        <!-- Increasing noise (sensitivity) will make your aircraft respond more rapidly, but will cause twitches due to noise. -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp 130 with RateNoise 08 for very smooth flight. -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp 110 with RateNoise 10 for default flight. -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp 100 with RateNoise 13 for very snappy flight. -->
        <!-- RateNoise is [0,30] default 10. -->
        <!-- RateDamp is [50,150] default 110. -->
        <!-- per https://github.com/d-ronin/dRonin/pull/811/files change min ratedamp to 85. -->
        <!-- So RateDamp is [85,150] default 110. -->
        <!-- Extrapolated multiplicatively: -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp 153.636363636 with RateNoise 06.4 for very very smooth flight. -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp  90.909090909 with RateNoise 16.9 for very very snappy flight. -->
        <!-- Extrapolated additively: -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp 150 with RateNoise 06 for very very smooth flight. -->
        <!-- Use RateDamp  90 with RateNoise 16 for very very snappy flight. -->
        <!-- use additive so the piecewise algorithm will give the exact recommended pairs at 25%, 50%, and 75% of slider -->
        <!-- -->
        <!-- So the following 6 fields set up the SmoothQuick slider using 3 known good damp and noise pairings. -->
        <!-- You can adjust just one end of SmoothQuick by changing e.g. the DampMin and NoiseMax pairing. -->
        <!-- You can maintain the known good ratio to simply extend or shrink the SmoothQuick scale. -->
        <!-- You can change the known good ratio e.g. if you find that the quick end of SmoothQuick tends to oscillate. -->
        <!-- You can change the default PIDs by changing the "center" values DampRate and NoiseRate. -->
        <!-- You can change the whole SmoothQuick slider uniformly by e.g. multiplying all Damp* fields by .75 -->
        <!-- You can shift the whole SmoothQuick slider up or down -->
        <!-- etc! -->
        <!-- on the SmoothQuick value scale of [-1,+1]: -->
        <!-- the default SmoothQuick value of 0.0 gives recommended default damp and rate for normal flight -->
        <!-- a SmoothQuick value of -0.5 gives the recommended damp and rate for very smooth flight -->
        <!-- a SmoothQuick value of +0.5 gives the recommended damp and rate for very quick flight -->
        <!-- a SmoothQuick value of -1.0 is extrapolated to give very very smooth flight while still being inside the range of sane values-->
        <!-- a SmoothQuick value of +1.0 is extrapolated to give very very quick flight while still being inside the range of sane values-->
        <!-- other values of SmoothQuick are interpolated or extrapolated from these -->
