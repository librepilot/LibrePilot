The best way to do least squares solving is with a SVD decomposition. Eigen provides one as the JacobiSVD class, and its solve()
is doing least-squares solving.

Here is an example:
<table class="example">
<tr><th>Example:</th><th>Output:</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>\include TutorialLinAlgSVDSolve.cpp </td>
  <td>\verbinclude TutorialLinAlgSVDSolve.out </td>
</tr>
</table>

For more information, including faster but less reliable methods, read our page concentrating on \ref LinearLeastSquares "linear least squares problems".
