vagrant_openpilot_dev - provides a Vagrant box with everything needed to compile LibrePilot code base. 

username: vagrant
password: vagrant

For details of an LibrePilot development environment please refer to the Development Manual https://librepilot.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LPDOC/Linux+-+Building+and+Packaging.

To enable Android Studio and Java, edit file install-tools.sh and set ANDROID_ENV=true. You might also want to adjust for the versions it downloads.

If you would like for VirtualBox window to open, this can be useful for running apps, set 'vb.gui = true' in Vagrant file. For now the vagrant shell (ssh) will not work when starting in GUI mode.

Setting up

1) Install vagrant on your host (https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)
2) Download the files in this folder to a working folder on your host. There is no need to retrieve the full repository.
3) in a command line select the working folder
4) Run the command 
$ vagrant up

Once your machine has started up you can ssh into it or log into Xfce (assuming you set vb.gui = true). Any changes you make persist in the Vagrant VM, when you are done run 'vagrant halt', this will turn off the vm and persist your changes.

$ vagrant ssh



To begin with LibrePilot base source is checked out into ~/workspace/librepilot. All necessary modules are initialized and SDK's installed.

You are now ready to browse the code. To build the code run the commands:
$ cd ~/workspace/librepilot
$ make all

If you wish to start all over:
$ vagrant halt 
$ vagrant destroy
